# docker-zola

This is a dockerfile for the Rust-based static site generator,
[Zola](https://www.getzola.org/). This image is based on Zola version 0.6.0,
and will be updated with later releases.

## Features

- Small size: The Zola 0.60 docker image is only 35.4 MB in size.
- Up-to-date: I'll create an updated docker image for each upstream Zola
  release.

docker pull j1mc/docker-zola
